      <h1>Hi, I'm Mahima Chandra</h1>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in the MERN
        (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and Java development. I
        enjoy building web applications and solving complex problems.

        I'm always learning and experimenting with new technologies to stay
        up-to-date in this fast-paced field. Currently, I'm focusing on
        deploying scalable full-stack applications and enhancing my skills in
        artificial intelligence.
